# Sample Weather Data

This directory contains sample weather data for MetDataPy tutorials and tests.

## Files

- `generate_sample_data.py` - Script to generate synthetic weather data
- `sample_weather_2024.csv` - Full year of 10-minute weather data (2024)
- `mapping.yml` - Auto-detected column mapping (generated by examples)
- `processed/` - Processed datasets (generated by examples)

## Sample Data Characteristics

The `sample_weather_2024.csv` dataset contains:

- **Time period**: 2024-01-01 to 2024-12-31
- **Frequency**: 10 minutes
- **Records**: ~52,000
- **Variables**:
  - Temperature (°F) - with seasonal and diurnal patterns
  - Relative Humidity (%) - inversely correlated with temperature
  - Atmospheric Pressure (mbar) - slow variations
  - Wind Speed (mph) - log-normal distribution
  - Wind Direction (°) - with persistence, NaN when wind is calm
  - Wind Gust (mph) - always >= wind speed
  - Rainfall (mm) - occasional events (5% probability)
  - Solar Radiation (W/m²) - time and season dependent
  - UV Index - proportional to solar radiation

## Intentional Anomalies

For QC demonstration purposes, the data includes:

1. **Temperature spikes** - Sudden jumps of 30-50°F (5 instances)
2. **Humidity flatlines** - Stuck sensor at 65% for 50 consecutive records
3. **Out-of-range values** - RH = 150%, Pressure = -10 mbar
4. **Data gaps** - Random missing values (~2% of data)

These anomalies are designed to be detected by MetDataPy's QC algorithms:
- Range checks catch out-of-range values
- Spike detection flags sudden jumps
- Flatline detection identifies stuck sensors
- Gap marking handles missing timestamps

## Generating Custom Data

You can generate custom sample data with different parameters:

```python
from generate_sample_data import generate_sample_weather_data

df = generate_sample_weather_data(
    start_date="2025-01-01",
    end_date="2025-12-31",
    freq="5min",  # 5-minute data
    add_gaps=True,
    add_anomalies=True,
    seed=123  # Different random seed
)

df.to_csv("custom_weather.csv", index=False)
```
